# randomizedtesting oracle harness

Java programs that run randomizedtesting 2.8.1 and JDK 25 on fixed inputs and
write the fixtures (`../*.tsv`) the crate's parity tests (`src/tests/`) read.

* **Rebuild everything:** `./regenerate.sh` (JDK 25; jars from `~/.m2` or
  `$M2_REPO`: randomizedtesting-runner 2.8.1, junit 4.13.1,
  hamcrest-core 1.3). It compiles every `src/**/*.java`, runs each class in
  `oracles.txt` with the output directory as its argument, copies the
  `*.tsv` files to `tests/fixtures/` and the JDK data lists to `src/jdk/data/`.
* **Format:** tab-separated rows, `#` comment lines. A sequence of values is
  `OracleSupport.Rec`: an FNV-1a 64-bit digest over the little-endian bytes
  of each value (`int`/`long` as is, `float`/`double` by raw bits, `boolean`
  as one byte, `byte[]` and `String` prefixed by a 4-byte length, strings as
  UTF-16 code units) plus the first value. Strings in inputs are written as
  hex UTF-16 code units joined by `.` (`-` when empty); errors as
  `class<TAB>message`. The Rust side is `src/tests/mod.rs` (`Rec`, `rows`,
  `from_units`, `java_error`).
* **Extend:** add a class under `src/com/carrotsearch/randomizedtesting/`
  (that package reaches the package-private members), use `OracleSupport`
  (`Rec`, `units`, `err`, `seeds`, `tryRecord`), write its own `*.tsv` names
  into the directory it receives, list it in `oracles.txt`, and add the Rust
  test module that reads the new files.
* **Lucene oracles:** the classes under `src/org/apache/lucene/` drive
  Lucene 10.5.0 (`lucene-core`, `lucene-codecs`, `lucene-test-framework`, on
  Hamcrest 2.2) for the other crates of the workspace. Each writes its files
  into `<out>/<crate>/`; `regenerate.sh` copies the `*.tsv` files to
  `crates/<crate>/tests/fixtures/` and the JDK data lists to
  `crates/<crate>/src/jdk/data/`. Their temporary directories are masked as
  `$D` and identity hash codes as `@HASH`.
* **`SimpleText` oracles:** `org.apache.lucene.codecs.simpletext.SimpleTextOracle`
  writes `crates/rucene-codecs/tests/fixtures/simpletext_*.tsv` (every file of
  the indexes it writes with `SimpleTextCodec`, what Lucene reads back, the
  errors of corrupted copies, the service lookups). Its reader,
  `SimpleTextReadOracle.java`, depends only on `lucene-core` and
  `lucene-codecs`: `crates/rucene-codecs/tests/simpletext_oracle.rs` also
  launches it as a single source file (`java -cp <jars>
  SimpleTextReadOracle.java <dir>`) on the indexes Rucene writes.
